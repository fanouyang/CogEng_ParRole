A,"After searching for scholarly articles that explore community, the results produced numerous papers and books that examine community around one's identity and personal needs.Merriam-Webster defines community as ""a unified body of individuals.""I would define community as a group of people that share a mutual identity, whether it be race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. Furthermore, I believe a community is comprised of people who strongly associate themselves with that group.For me, an ""online community"" is one where the definitions above are present but, perhaps even more important, people are able to develop a true social presence. In other words, members of the group must be able to develop and convey a true sense of themselves that includes their personality, passions, interests, and emotions. In order to do this, members must engage clearly and frequently, as well as communicate effectively. I really like the book's definition of online communities as a virtual space where people ""come together in meaningful ways"" and with a sense of ""purpose."" Additionally, it is important for whichever platform is being utilized to have a clear structure. This is my vision of a successful online community. It's when people bring all parts of themselves to an online space, using a variety of technology, and are able to use the structure of the virtual space to help other members gain a perspective (and hopefully an accurate one) of who they are. Community members learn about one another, develop common interests, and eventually trust each other enough to rely on members and look to each other to learn more about others and themselves. With our culture being heavily dependent on body language to help us decipher messages and a need for face-to-face interactions, I believe developing a strong, viable online community poses great difficulty. I come from a background where online communities feel a little unnatural, so I am very excited to stretch myself outside of my comfort zone and I look forward to developing peer relationships in a virtual space.

R,"After reading the first chapter of ""Building online learning communities"" and searching for some articles and Wikipedia information, I have had an initial conception of ""online learning community"". In my opinion, two kinds of actors- facilitator and learner are fundamental factors in online learning community. Various online activities performed by these two kinds of actors comprise a online social context. This constructivist context is called online learning community. More importantly, only this constructivist context can be considered as ""online learning community"". Communities which are used as a platform to deliver teaching materials by instructors are not ""online learning community"".In order to form a social constructivist context, facilitator should clarify course goals, objectives, expected outcomes, guidelines, collaborative assignments to learners. During the learning process, the learner who is open-minded sharing, self-motivated and self-disciplined are more likely to be a successful online learner. Online activities (performed by both learners and facilitator) include social presence, collaborative activities, interactions and communications, reflective and transformative learning, etc. Details of these concepts please watch my Prezi shown below.My Prezi: What's online learning community?I believe community is important in online learning spaces. Because I believe learning is a social process. Online community is the space people share their thoughts, ideas, reflections, skills, technologies and make communications and interactions with others.

E,"When I think about defining online community, I think about how I as a program evaluator would think about it as an intervention in learning and what that may ""look like"". I reviewed a few published studies that evaluated different online communities (learning and professional). _The online communities that ""succeeded"" by some measure included these aspects: high engagement (measured by frequency of participation, depth of participation, or particular participation patterns), shared sense of vision (in most cases this was centered on a particular aspect of learning), _and sense of belonging or community loyalty (self report paired with measures of participation). The studies also discussed motivations such as relevance of knowledge sharing in community and perceived advantage of belonging and participating. The studies also either measured or discussed the role of self efficacy in fostering engagement. Participants needed to be confident enough in their own ability to share knowledge to be engaged.In a learning community it seems like it would be important to figure out what strengths different members bring to the table, scaffold discussions so that varied expertise is valued, and establish the trust among members early and consistently. I liked the ""Building Online Learning Communities' reference to conscious community - the need for personal growth and transformation as part of that definition.The other piece that seemed missing from the studies I found was thinking about the role of discourse in building knowledge or learning in the community. It was perhaps implicit in the different measures of weblogs aItics from these studies but that seems to miss the constructivist thinking that R described in Prezi.Thinking about the definition makes me realize the challenges of thinking about evaluation with respect to online communities.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Week 02,1,Mediator

In the paper, Building a Dynamic Online Learning Community among Adult Learners, it notes evidence of an online community forming from three markers: active participation, the forming of a shared identity, and the establishment of a social network. Without participation, you lack interaction, and therefore lack any opportunities to learn from each other (such through constructivism or active learning [noted in our book]).

O,"I definitely agree that an online learning environment has certain advantages in creating _opportunities for connection and learning:- In a physical space, there are restrictions on how many people can interact at one time, whereas in an online environment there aren't really physical limitations for how many people can join. - In an online space both public and private conversations can occur (more or less) simultaneously. In an online space, it is possible to pay attention to the main class discussion and connect with class members individually, in the same span of time, whereas in a f2f class it's rude to have side conversations during a discussion! - An online community affords more breadth and depth in a discussion. There's more breadth because everyone gets to write their response, so we get to hear from everyone's unique perspective. As far as depth, in a spoken conversation, there's a ""flow"", and sometimes things get interrupted, or topics are passed over that could be discussions more deeply. There's more depth with an online conversation board because it's easy to return to past discussions and add more thoughts. Also, when we write text, that makes it much easier to reply exactly to what another person has said. This speaks to what F was saying about an environment that is ""challenging"". In part, an online discussion is challenging because we have so much more breadth and depth in our discussions to contend with.- Online spaces can be appealing - not always in the same ways as physical spaces, but both can be aesthetically appealing. It's usually easier/less expensive to ""remodel"" an online space to better suite its members. Often there's more ""room"" in an online space for members to add their own individuality, like how we can add our personal photos to this group site.

M,"Hi All,Please forgive me...I went a little crazy in my post! _I promise to keep it more succinct next time.For a number of years I taught online classes both asynchronously and synchronously. _I was never officially trained or educated how to do it, but got lots of advice from colleagues along the way who had been teaching online. _I stumbled a lot and learned a lot. _Some semesters, my online classes were my favorites, students engaged in ways I had never seen in my face-to-face classes. _Other semesters, to be honest, I just couldnêt wait for it to be over. _Reflecting upon my experiences I know that it had a lot to do with building community. _This was the key reason I wanted to take this class. _How do you build effective online communities?In reading the Palloff and Pratt text, there were a few key items that struck me in terms of building community. _Excuse the long quote, but when I read this I couldnêt help but think this is so dang true!There is one important element, however, that sets online distance learning apart from the traditional classroom setting: Key to the learning process are the interactions among students themselves, the interactions between faculty and students, and the collaboration in learning that results from these interactions. _In other words, the formation of a learning community through which knowledge is imparted and meaning is co-created sets the stage for successful learning outcomes. (Palloff and Pratt, 2007, p. 4) I think about the semesters I loathed my online classes and I know they were the semesters that I was frustrated by my studentsê participation or lack thereof. _I was frustrated that they were not contributing at the level I wanted them to. _SoÛI became a bit of a tyrant, demanding that they do things in a very specific way. _In a face-to-face class teachers can do that more, we can control the conversations that take place, redirect it in a way we want it to go in a very short amount of time. _It only takes the teacherês questioning or direct comment and everyone hears it all at once and know to move the conversation that way. _This is not true of online threaded discussions because not everyone is there at that precise moment. _But, thatês also the point. _Like the quote says, there is collaboration in the learning, not a teacher dictating how the learning is to take place. _That's what makes it a unique community!Another item from the text that struck me was that successful students in distance education programs are _able to communicate through writingî (Palloff and Pratt, 2007, p. 8). I couldnêt help but think that talkers _winî in f-2-f classes, but writers _winî in online classes. _But, donêt good writers always win? _That is, ultimately in higher education if you are a strong writer no matter f-2-f or online you will come out on top because after all the major assignments always involve writing. _How can we change that dynamic, even just a little, so that more people can win?Finally, I am intrigued by the difference between presence and interaction as described on page 12. _I think about some stories I have read about how people have become actually lonelier or depressed through social media such as Facebook (FB). _In most of these stories the key was that on FB and other social media people are marketing themselves. _That is, they are posting images of themselves on vacation or some other fantastic place because they want to show the world how great their life is. _Itês almost like marketing a product. _If this is true, then wouldnêt that be considered presence, but not true interaction? _As in, the comments below the wonderful picture, _looks like fun,î _you look amazing!î, etc.? _It seems to me friends are acknowledging presence not truly interacting. _OK, donêt get me wrong, I am just as guilty of this stuff as anyoneÛIêm just contemplating this idea. In looking for an article that discusses community I found an interesting one: _Developing Online Learning Communitiesî by Mark. A. Maddix in Christian Education Journal (Series 3, Vol. 10, No.1). _I am neither Christian nor religious, but I found this article intriguing because it deals with the idea of larger community values within an individual classroom community. _In Christian universities one of the elements of their teaching is helping young people in the forming and shaping of their faith. _Classes, therefore, are not just about the content (e.g., history, chemistry), but about modeling Christian values and beliefs. _The concern is that in online classes these values and beliefs may not be modeled. _Moreover, some theologians argue that embodiment is key to molding these beliefs and values and physical presence is necessary. _Maddix presents an alternative viewpoint through various research. _Of particular interest to me is John Greshamês research that argues for a _divine pedagogyî or __the pedagogy of the incarnation [that] points to the realm of the student's life experience as the locus of divine saving actionî (Maddix, p. 142 and Gresham, 2006, p. 26). _In other words, to use Greshamês language again, _divine pedagogy includes a communal dimension similar to the church, [it] provides active participation of students in the learning process, and is relevant to online education because it is rich in symbols and signs that communicate meaningî (Maddix, p. 142 and Gresham 2006, p. 27-28). _I read such statements as a redefining of community or rather we must not assume that we are a community simply because we share similar values and beliefs. _Rather we must continuously build community and allow the actors to be active, challenged, and provide space for difference and growth. _In other words, we canêt just say our community has these values and beliefs and that you will pick them up simply by your presence. _I like this.In sum, then, an online community really needs to be genuine in its efforts to be a community. _We can't just be together in this space, we need to engage in it.",0,8,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,Week 02,1,Leader

The term community is generally defined as usually small, social unit of any size that shares common values. So based on this definition online learning community is the small social unit of any size that shares learning about some topic through online. The reason i called it as small challenge is that the online class has some differences form the off line class and due to those differences it could be more challenging than normal class. I have taken three online classes and the online class needs more participation and responsibility than normal class i think. According to text book, learning in the distance education environment cannot be passive.

So, I think of my profession of dental hygiene, living within the ecosystem of organized dentistry. Every-so-often, state Boards of Dentistry make major changes to the individual services that a dental hygienist can legally provide to their patients. So, this larger ecosystem change can greatly impact my dental hygiene community. Additionally, these dental hygiene members can be affected by other ecosystems, like the dental insurance ecosystem, which could decide that having one's teeth cleaned, x-rayed and examined should no longer be a covered benefit, which would have profound effects on both my dental hygiene community and its larger ecosystem of organized dentistry, at a minimum. So, this has caused me to think about community not as an insular, members-only club, but rather as a dynamic group which is constantly acting and reacting to what's taking place both within and without the community - the ""issues, media, people, competition and trends"" (Millington) affecting this group of people are what really constitute an online community.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Week 02,1,Starter

O," Identify 2 highlights from the readings. These could be quotes, ideas, or things you learned that resonated with you.One quote that stuck out to me was from page 163, chapter 8: ""Asking participants to comment on expectations gives the instructor a process check, a means by which to determine whether or not everyone is beginning this journey from approximately the same starting point."" This procedure of collaboratively determining the course goals is important not only for student buy-in, but also for the instructor's growth in the subject matter. The check-in with students about their expectations about what they are learning is important for the instructor to stay up-to-date on what knowledge is relevant in the real world, especially in classes geared towards adults who have practical experience of their own, and in subjects where the research and content is still evolving. Another quote that jumped out at me was from page 167, chapter 8: ""The process of connecting the learning gained from everyday life to the learning of the course not only creates a deeper sense of meaning for the participants but it validates them as people who possess knowledge and who can apply what they know in other contexts.""I happened to be reading another book recently that had a similar discussion. It was talking about how learners who automatically or deliberately connect what they are learning to things they already know tend to have a lot greater success in using and retaining their new knowledge. The challenge is that many learners don't do this automatically, but they will if asked. I wish that this learning about learning was something that was an automatic part of every class at every level of education, because it is so useful for life-long learning.  What is 1 connection/disconnection among the readings?I thought there was a strong connection between both chapter 8 and 9 and our previous discussion of communities of practice. Particularly the skill of providing substantial feedback (chapter 8 around page 176-179) jumped out to me as incredibly important for a community of practice to have value for its members. Considering our former class topics and readings, what is 1 connection/disconnection to CI 5323 overall?This course has been very deliberate in its self-reflective aspect, since we are reading about online communities while actively participating in them. Instructor deliberately asked those ""expansive questions"" to get us to think about how the suggestion from the text are/are not enacted in our online community, including both broadly thinking about the course, and reflecting on our own roles within the course. So the course is very ""meta"" in a way :-) What is 1 question or puzzle that you still have regarding the readings?I found chapter 8 to be a very practical discussion because collaboration is important for the workplace as well as in online learning communities. A question that popped into my head around page 170 is : What skills/roles/similarities exist between the online facilitator and a supervisor/manager in a professional setting? You could also ask what are the similarities between learners and employees in terms of collaboration.

M,"Hi Everyone,I'm in a coffee shop, so I am opting to write (both for privacy and bandwidth), but isn't this the fun of taking an online class -- you can do it in a coffee shop!Some highlights for me:I'm a big fan of ""dialogue as inquiry"" as stated on pages 170-171.  It reminds me of the purpose of social studies education (which I am studying).  Schools are perhaps the most democratic places students will find themselves in.  That is, outside of school students are often with like-minded people, either through their own friends, parents' friends, relatives, religious organizations etc.  It is in school that we need to develop their ability to dialogue with people unlike themselves.  In an online environment, as the authors suggest, this kind of dialogue is set up right away and it builds.  If the instructor provides ""encouraging expansive questions"" and steps back the students will take over the dialogue.  The authors use Brookfield and Preskill's findings (2005) stating as such, ""the more successful students are at collaborating, the more they will seek it out"" (p. 171).  In my experiences of both teaching online and f-2-f, it seems in the online environment this collaboration, while sometimes more difficult actually produces better results.  The process matters!Another highlight for me is ""learning about technology by using it"", pages 195-196.  Simply put, I want my mom and dad to take an online class!  They keep asking me questions about technology that are out of context and it's extremely frustrating.  I strongly believe that if they took an online class they would not only gain confidence in their technological skills, but recognize the power of technology to learn in ways that meets the needs of the adult learner.Connections/Disconnections among readings:This book must have been difficult to write.  I say this because everything is so connected.  Topics loop and loop again.  Transformative learning takes place through the collaborative process, right?  At least that's how I see it.  Through collaboration and learning about your own strengths and weaknesses of collaborating with others you can't help but transform.  You cannot help but reflect on how it is going and your own role and how you would do it better.  So, to me it's all one big string that is looping back on itself.Connections/Disconnections to other topics in class:I'm still a little caught up in communities of practice.  I think that they can be wonderful and amazing if everyone is committed to them.  Otherwise, it could simply be a bunch of people who happen to do the same thing and they talk about it sometimes.  This is where the reflection piece discussed in Chapter 9 becomes important.  I think I'd like to see more reflection both individuals and the group would be important in a community of practice.  Otherwise, the potential for growth as a community become limited.  Through reflection you get to see your strengths and areas for growth.Puzzle:As I read the text, it mirrors my experiences as an online instructor and as an online student.  That is, they really push for the instructor to set up the class for student interaction and if the instructor does it well, they can step out of the way.  OK, yes.

G,"Hi M,Your last paragraph is something that resonated with me...echoes what I have been thinking about for a while, but in reverse! How can discussions around sensitive topics transfer to an online space? Here's the background...As part of my previous program, I also completed a minor in another CEHD department. Their courses, at the grad level, are mostly F2F. There was a great deal of discussion a while back about moving their certificate program online, but ultimately the faculty decided that the online space was not conducive to the types of discussions that they wanted to cultivate in the classroom. Discussions around power, privilege, social justice, classim, racism, many heavy topics that call for a skilled teacher/facilitator who has experience working with groups consisting of individuals at different points in their awareness of these topics. As an educator, how can the potentially transformative process of education work online, and what do I need to do in order to make that happen? (""make"" is not really the word I wanted to use here, as no one can make someone change their views, but I'm referring more to the process side as the educator/facilitator would have more control of that, at least in the initial course design aspect).I read the linked article that you provided. It was a fascinating read, and it reminded me of an article I read a while back (actually, for a course in the minor program I described above) that talked about similar ideas as yours - namely, how to encourage and work through healthy conflict in a classroom when sensitive topics are the topic of discussion. It is vitally important that students know how to talk about decisive topics in a mixed group (meaning multiple viewpoints are represented) as it's something they will encounter all through their life.Do you think the age of the learners plays a part in what format these discussions would take? Are there some skills that need to be learned f2f with others before taking the discussions online?",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,Week 08,0,Influencer
M,"Hi G,I just had a moment to skim your article, but promise to really read it later b/c it definitely intrigues me. _To speak personally to your issue, I have taught a class called ""Teaching in A Diverse Society"" online and it was a bear of a class to teach. _As you indicate, the students were at all different levels of awareness on issues of power, racism, sexism, etc. that are required to teach in such a course. _I found that when I taught it online, but had the students in another class f-2-f they trusted me more and were more willing to take risks. _When I taught it exclusively online I had to really work to build trust, but ultimately many of the students saw me as ""in their face"" about these issues of diversity. _This is one reason I'm taking this course, should I ever teach the above mentioned course again I know I need to work on building more trust and community. On an interesting side note, I just so happened to have a conversation about this with a former colleague who is a woman of color. _Whenever she teaches this diversity class for pre-service teachers she prefers to teach it online. _She says often being the only person of color in the room and the person who has power as the teacher can be extremely uncomfortable for her and her students. _It's a power dynamic the students are not used to and when she presents such sensitive topics that you describe she knows her students hold back so as not to offend her. _Which, of course, is the opposite of what she wants - she wants them to ask questions and to make themselves vulnerable in their learning because ultimately she knows that these pre-service teachers will be working with students and families that are different from them.So, in the end I don't have an answer to your question because I think it's all contextual. _I do think this, however, no matter the format the instructor needs to find out what level of awareness the students are at and figure out ways to make space for them to blunder along the way so that they can move on the spectrum of awareness and action. _I also think we need to make space for K-12 educators to bring back the controversial issues so that by the time they come to college they are prepared to deal with differences in a variety of ways and to feel OK that there is never a ""right"" answer.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,Week 08,0,Leader

G,"Two highlights from the readings:need to connect course content with ""real world"" happenings - in other words, having the students either answer the question of ""when am I going to use this?"" or helping them make the connections. Sometimes, even as adult learners we may need help with that. I'm thinking specifically of the ""problems, interests, and experiences as springboards for learning"" section in Ch 8.learning about technology by using it - especially true. One example for me - using Twitter. I initially started my master's program with the goal of moving into academic advising. There were not many students in my program with similar career interests, and I came across two weekly Twitter chats that were helpful - one for academic advisors, and one for student affairs (#sachat) pros. Through these chats I felt somewhat more connected to others who shared my professional interests. I still follow some of the acad adv and sachat folks, but now it's mostly been taken over by edtech :) Using Twitter has helped me experience firsthand the role that social networks can play in learning. Connection/disconnection:Thinking back to the section on introductions, I was surprised to read about the description of the student who was not present online for a while due to the lack of comments on his/her introduction (I will add page #s here later - my book and I are in two different places right now, and I didn't write down the pg #s in my notes) . While it was written in the context of an online class, for some reason it made me think back on other f2f grad courses that I have taken, and the role that introductions played in those courses. (I've been thinking quite a bit lately about what it means to teach online v. f2f - what changes, what stays the same, etc from the perspective of an instructor.) I'm wondering if introductions in an online course, and the following responses, could actually make for deeper connections to occur - especially having the instructor model a response. In the f2f classes that I took, we did not get a chance to personally respond to each person's introduction. Connection/disconnection to CI 5323: It has been terrific to see how this class models what is talked about and explained in our text. The question that I started the M.Ed. LT program with, ""What does high-quality, engaging online learning look like, and how can I do it?"" has begun to be answered in leaps and bounds throughout this class. I maybe should have added ""formal"" to my question too, now that I think about it, as to me there's some pretty significant distinctions between informal and formal online learning. Question or puzzle that you still have: Content organization when the class reaches the halfway+ point. In Ch 8, the instructor/one of the authors posed a question about creating a meta space for reflection of the overall online learning process and other items learners may have questions about (again, will add page #s here later).

It says, _All of us need acknowledgement and to feel welcomed into a new situation. The promotion of human connection allows students to begin forming the relationships that are the basis for collaborative learning.î (Chapter 8, pp.164).Introduction is a traditional and excellent icebreaker, and also it facilitates the building of social presence. Comment from peers is something of significance to make one feel being accepted and welcomed, and not a dispensable visitor, which will affect oneês positivity and initiative to join further class activities to a great extent. Moreover, initiating communication and interaction from comment helps to build relationships among classmates in a short time, and indirectly devotes to the development of sense of a community.Another quote struck me out is that _critical self-reflection is a crucial component of transformative learning and that, in fact, transformative learning cannot occur without itî (Chapter 9, pp.198). As transformative learning is the process of perspective transformation, and it is about who I am as a person, have I changed and how I changed. So, self-reflection, which does answer those questions, plays a critical role in transformative learning. What is 1 connection/disconnection among the readings? From my point of view, Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 are closely tied together. Chapter 8, _Promoting Collaborative Learningî, talks about the means of formulation of a share goal for learning, real-life applications as springboards for learning, and dialogue as inquiry, which seems like the preparation, and means towards _Transformative Learningî that Chapter 9 is about. What is 1 question/puzzle that you still have regarding the readings? While I was reading examples of posts by Mike in pp.201, a question bumped into my mind. Students attempt to express who they are textually in an online course, however, it seems informal to write assignments that way.

Q,"It seems that questioning and higher order thinking skills are mentioned on page 171 under encouraging expansive questioning. It is stated that ""when students become excited by the learning that expansive questions create, they can become adept at asking the same types of questions themselves. This serves to propel the learning of all involved to much higher levels"".In teaching this is the most challenging as the facilitator has to guide and redirect students to achieve that goal. It works with some groups and some students struggle with it. As a facilitator you cannot provide too many leads in the direction of critical thinking as the group must critically expand their own thoughts. Content background knowledge is the starting point but where it can go from there depends upon the group with some groups needing more facilitation than others. The key lies in the balance of providing too many leads or too little support. The ways to add more collaboration is through ""blogs, wikis, web pages, jigsaw activities, online journals, webQuests"" etc that encourage learning through activities that encourage and support collaboration.The connection between the readings is clear in the process and the implementation phases of teaching and learning.

R,"I decide to use text posting here :) Identify 2 highlights from the readings. These could be quotes, ideas, or things you learned that resonated with you. 1. In page 158, Jonassen and others note that the collaborative in a constructivist classroom results not only in personal meaning-making on the part of the individual student, but also creates a container wherein social construction of knowledge and meaning can occur. This means that learning is not only an independent behavior by learners themselves, but also an interdependent process among learners. It's also important to form a constructivist community which helps learners to achieve active and reflective learning. 2. In page 162-163, two ways would help achieve collaborative learning are proposed. One is sharing the expectations of the course and another one is use of team charters. I will use these methods in my online course in the next semester.What is 1 connection/disconnection among the readings? One connection I have found is about the learner-centered focus. In a successful online learning community, we may have a close look at roles of students and instructors. Instructor is an equal player, acting only as a gentle guide while learners' roles might be a facilitator, team Leader, presenter or commentator. And instructors must be willing to give up control of the direction and act as a participating member, allowing students to take the discussion wherever it might go. Considering our former class topics and readings, what is 1 connection/disconnection to CI 5323 overall or prior readings? I think this course has formulated a good shared goal, negotiating guidelines and kind communication environment which are very important for our social presences online. It also has formed a context that we could bring our life experiences into this online course. For example, we all introduce an online community that we are interested in in our daily lives in this course. What is 1 question or puzzle that you still have regarding the readings? My question is how to make a team-evaluation? What the difference between team-evaluation and self-evaluation?",0,4,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,Week 08,1,Mediator
A,"Hi R,The difference between a self-evaluation and a team-evaluation is that you are only evaluating yourself in the former. The self-evaluation gives you a chance to reflect on your effort and provides the instructor with an idea of how you feel you performed. On the other hand, a team-evaluation gives all members of the team an opportunity to assess your performance. Often times, team members' ratings are averaged. When this feedback is shared with the instructor, it allows the instructor to gain better insight on how the team worked together. If all of the team members have good things to say about each other, we assume they worked well together. If all the team members identify a single person as a ""slacker,"" this is also noteworthy. One thing that should always be considered, however, is that sometimes team members don't say anything negative because they fear that this may affect their grade or that others may not share the same feelings and they don't want to put an unnecessary light on themselves. I hope this helps answer your question!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Week 08,0,Influencer

H,"These are good comments pertaining to team evaluations. _I had to evaluate team papers or lesson plans. _This is a bit different than having to evaluate a team member in a group project. _So as I become an instructor I will keep in mind that I want positive and strength base approach, so I would keep it as an approach to strengthen each others work. _For example, if we as a team evaluated another teams community site, we could critique it in the strength base approach, looking for the positive and ways to support the team to be more effective as an instructor (if needed) Does that make sense???",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,Week 08,0,Mediator
A,"Highlights. One of the simple ideas that I really like is that shared goals are a critical component of developing an effective community. One of the reasons I find academic communities to be much more effective than non-academic communities is that instructors and students naturally work toward clear goals that are tied to learning and completing the course. When utilizing a non-academic community, members may not necessarily be working toward common goals. They may be searching for advice or support but what they do with that information and, ultimately, their end-goal may not be the same. Connections. Chapter 9 discusses learning about technology by using it. This jumped out at me right away because that is exactly the feeling I've had during this course, thus far. I have learned about a number of new technologies and it wasn't until I actually used the technology (e.g., VoiceThread, Flipgrid) that I saw it's true value and could appreciate the medium. I believe this also means that there is some pressure on instructors to utilize the best types of technology, as well as a wide variety of technologies to allow students to gain exposure and promote learning.I thought the example of the female student who disappeared for awhile after her introduction was interesting, too. I believe we have come across this example before. I think this is definitely noteworthy because it demonstrates expectations and the impact not meeting those expectations has on people. This example reminds me a little bit of Facebook and how people often post status updates or photos and truly measure how many friends they have by the number of ""likes"" or responses. I think this is potentially destructive but, no doubt, plays a huge role in online communities. I suppose the takeaway is that we need to manage our expectations, as well as communicate clearly, and we shouldn't measure our worth by the feedback. Additionally, this relates to the point I made in the beginning of the semester where we should try to view others in a positive light, as opposed to negatively. We shouldn't assume non-responses mean that people don't care but rather they didn't know they were supposed to respond or got really busy. Question. Chapter 8 discusses being a team player in terms of collaboration. A number of my classes that place on emphasis on group work require a group assessment at the end where group members rate the effort of their team members and the teacher uses it when calculating a final grade.

I donêt think I was particularly ready to student teach or overly confident in my first few years of teaching, but the support of my colleagues and being confronted with unique situations every day has given me quite a collection of stories and material on which to reflect and learn from. I am on year 8 right now in my current position and although I feel like I am more than prepared to handle the content side of my job, the teaching aspect is something I am constantly reflecting, adjusting, tweaking, and revising as standards, teacher evaluations, students, and administration change from year to year. I have really enjoyed the opportunity to bring in my experiences from my classroom along with the opportunities to reflect on my current practice whether it is online or f2f. Although I am not currently facilitating any online courses, the knowledge I am gaining and combining with my current instruction is creating some excitement for the future and what direction I see my classes headed in.P.187 _ Mezirow (1990) states that perspectives are transformed when learners encounter what he terms disorienting dilemmas _ dilemmas that cause the learner to critically assess distortions in the areas of the nature and use of knowledge, belief systems related to power and social relationships, and psychic distortions _ or presuppositions that cause anxiety and inaction.This statement holds a great deal of truth for myself, as this is my first true online course. As much as I thought I was prepared for learning in this manner, there was a great deal of anxiety on my part as we began our journey into online learning communities. I am not a very organized person outside of those things I can feel direct control over and the openness of the course freaked me out the most. I completed my first online course (Research Methods from UW-RF) in the fall and it was nothing like this one. The instructor was the only person I dealt with and never communicated with my peers. As I work my way through this class, I find myself constantly reflecting on how I view the delivery of knowledge and the use of online communities. It has given me so much more to think about, much of which I was not aware of its existence. My perspective has definitely changed to be more open to how knowledge is acquired and how in so many ways online courses are more beneficial for some types of learners.What is 1 connection/disconnection among the readings?I see feedback and reflection being connected topics that most interest me in these two readings. When considering the most important factors in building relationships and in turn creating beneficial collaborative opportunities, trust has to be paramount.As we give feedback and read comments from our peers, the gears begin to move. We examine where we are in the world and our beliefs on whatever the topic may be and evaluate whether there is room for change or adjustment. Feedback drives our reflection and the ways in which our classmates challenge our ideas, thoughts, and comments.

C,"Highlights:One quote that really resonated with me is found on pg.171; ""Brookfeld and Preskill (2005) state that collaboration can become addictive: the more successful students are at collaborating, the more they will seek it out. Therefore, promoting good, collaborative discussion can assist them in developing an appreciation for other forms of collaborative work."" After reading this, I had a ""hmmm"" moment as it really made me think about my experiences in collaborating with other students, both in class, and other online and f2f classes I've taken in the past. Does collaboration really become addictive for me? I don't necessarily agree, but I do agree that good collaborative discussions assist in developing an appreciation for other forms of collaborative work. I also appreciated the quote on pg. 179 from Stephen Covey (1989), discussing the ability to ""seek first to understand, then be understood."" This further defines the importance of interdependence and the need for each online learner to gravitate towards interdependence to have more meaningful collaborative discussions. What is 1 connection/disconnection among the readings? The strongest connection among the two chapters for me was its ability to tie collaboration to transformational learning. I see a strong connection between integrating collaboration into an online learning environment and then being able to create a transformational experience for the student. Even though transformational experiences are usually unconsciously driven, it's imperative to integrate collaborative learning exercises and activities into an online course, so those transformational experiences come to light. I felt these two chapters connected with each other really well and helped me to understand how to build collaboration and transformation together within a course.

We've talked about that before, but I find it interesting to think about the way that works. I also like the idea of ""when I succeed, we succeed,"" but I wonder why it wasn't stated conversely as, ""when we succeed, I succeed,"" since that would answer the participants' natural question, ""How do I succeed?""In chapter 9, I was particularly struck by what I thought was an outrageous statement, _If students were informed in advance that a process of transformation would be the outcome of their participation of their participation in an academic course, would they be likely to enroll?î I thought maybe I'd read that wrong because I can't actually think of a better reason to enroll. It's interesting that they go from lamenting the traditional instructor's reluctance to promote transformative learning to what they suggest is the learner's reluctance to embrace it. I have certainly experienced the former--from preschool through college, I encountered both kinds of instructors--those who seek to encourage learning and those who seek to control it. I have a particularly sharp memory of scribbling down the word ""synesthesia,"" when I first heard it and having the prof glare at me and say, ""Don't bother writing it down--it won't be on the test."" I thought, ""You jerk, I paid for this course and I'll learn what I want to, thank you very much!"" I didn't, of course, say that.What is 1 disconnection among the readings?Chapter 8 and chapter 9 describe closely interrelated ideas of how to construct knowledge and meaning, but I did see a disconnection between chapter 8's description of consciously building community, and their assertion in chapter 9 that,  _...we do not inform learners up front in our course outcomes or expectations that they are engaging in a learning community or that transformation will be the result of the course.î Huh?Considering our former class topics and readings, what is 1 connection/disconnection to CI 5323 overall?All along, our reads have addressed how to build and how to understand community in an online course, and I can point to many things in chapters 8 and 9 that are lived out in the online course that Instructor set in motion and that we're building together: collaboration, introductions, ice-breaking activities, negotiating expectations, reflecting in blogs, learning tech through using it, etc. It's almost a game to think--ok, how are we doing THAT one?The part about not informing us right away that we're building community would be a disconnection.What is 1 question or puzzle that you still have regarding the readings?I think the authors may be confusing traditional pedagogy with traditional settings when they say, _students in a traditional setting...are not always expected to apply it to their own lives or reflect on its potential impactÛî Unless they're using ""traditional setting"" to actually mean ""traditional pedagogy.""

S,"One of the things that I hadn't given much thought to previously was the importance of not only having students introduce themselves to each other in the first week of an online course, but that it is important for each new member to acknowledge the other individuals in their class, in return. This 2-way dynamic may not be necessary between all members of the class, but it sure helps members find common ground and a sense of being a valued member of the community.A second realization I came to in the readings was the idea that, with ""the additional component of letting students share resources...a greatly expanded bibliography of readings can be developed to allow students to explore far beyond the confines of the readings assigned for the course."" (Ch. 8, P. 181) This is what I find so fascinating about this form of instruction, its collaborative nature and thereby, its expansiveness. With this comes the challenge of reigning it in, at times; to stay on task when you're curiosity wants to take you in yet another direction.In our Oliver, Harrington, Harrington & Reeves article, the authors make the distinction within group work between simple cooperation in the division of roles and responsibilities, and collaboration, which affords more opportunities for learning through increased knowledge generation and improved problem solving. In this way, the group can accomplish more than any one individual. ""Well-designed collaborative learning activities capture the dynamic of real world complexity."" (Oliver, Harrington, Harrington & Reeves, p. 2). Our book goes a bit further with this idea on P. 157 where it discusses Johnson & Johnson's (2005) ""positive group interdependence"", referring to the sink or swim together dynamic which most of us live in our daily work and personal lives.Finally, one area of uncertainty I have relates to how team members evaluate each others' performance. Although I've read studies showing that this type of peer review performs as well as instructor evaluations, I have a hard time believing this.

Your learning style does become impacted by one's life events and learning process growing up, though.

Community colleges attract a diverse student body.  I wonder if those who took the online class were working adults (that is, adults with full time jobs)?  While those who took it f-2-f tended to be younger?  The article was written in 1999, prior to any online course management systems such as Moodle or Ning, etc., so it seemed more like a ""correspondence"" class of ""old days"", but instead of mailing in the materials they did it via email.  Would that appeal to an older audience that may have had experience with correspondence classes?  Another thought, I wonder about the issue of flexibility too?

So I guess I think to a large extent that we are just socialized into being comfortable with a particular way of receiving information.

Also the visual learners commonly use visual aids, such as  graphs or diagrams, to assist them in putting material into perspective However, after I read all the readings, I recognized that i am also  part of auditory learner.

G,"Do you think you can change your learning style?I don't think that we can consciously change our learning style, but the better we understand ourselves, the better we will be able to learn. We can make accommodations for ourselves and find ways to make delivered materials better suit how we learn. For example, when watching instructional videos, I frequently turn on the captions, as it's easier for me to process the info if I can read it. (I also do this when I watch TV, which used to drive my family nuts, but they have gradually adapted to it and now humor me. It helps to balance out the sound levels between programs and commercials!) It also makes me more aware of how many people forget to either check the captioning when they upload their videos. How can you use your learning style beneficially?I found the tips in the website and pdf to be very helpful. It's one thing to know you fall into a particular category, but without knowing what to do with that info, it can also not be helpful. Those tips bridge the gap. It can also help educators think about how to best structure their class and/or learning materials so they can be used by learners wherever they are at without the need for additional accommodations (this is starting to sound like universal design...) What do you think Diaz & Cartnal meant when they stated ""There are probably as many ways to teach as there are to learn?îThis seems like an important point to keep in mind, and for me, it's one of the most difficult! Many years ago, I was pressured into teaching a class of English-language learners. I tried to prepare some materials, but as I quickly found out, the adults who were in that class were all over the place in terms of their skill levels and what they needed. I was in way over my head, and felt that I was doing them an incredible disservice by being there. I'm sharing this story as it came into my mind when I was reading this article and thinking about the types of learners presented by the GRSLSS categories.What learning style do you most identify with, and does it fit with online learning?In one of my other grad courses, our instructor asked us to take a quiz which helped us to identify what types of learners we were. According to that quiz, I learn best by reading and writing. Those results corresponded to the categories in this week's resources - which labeled me as mostly a visual learner, although I have used some of the techniques/aides described for auditory learners. Online learning, at this time, seems to be best suited for visual and auditory learners. I expect that as it moves along, and more educators experiment with electronic pedagogy, affordances for kinesthetic learners will grow.As a side note, were others able to locate the quiz in the pdf?

I found this quiz especially helpful because it invited me to check more than one box. I found that I almost always wanted to check more than one box. It made me think about our intro class and a discussion about reinforcing learning from different perspectives. I think it's useful to look at a concept from more than one angle--and to be asked to explain it to someone else, in speech, writing or demonstration (like tying the ties). If I can do that, I'm confident I've understood it. I inflict concepts new to me on my husband on a Regular basis, as I once did on my mother.

S,"As far as changing one's learning style, I don't think so. Can you learn to build skills in another learning style? Very likely, but your underlying style will probably remain dominant. To make efficient use of your style, you could (inward-facing) review study materials in the format most conducive to your style, and (outwardly) deliver content to your students utilizing your skills in this way. Having said that, while I take in information best in visual form, I have a hard time ""drawing a picture"" for learners, as this requires hand-eye and/or artistic strengths, and I'm not a good artist. But I would likely favor images/videos to convey content to my students over an audio recording. I would have to make a conscious effort to choose methods that are less visual in nature.Diaz and Cartnal meant that people do not fit neatly into any one style of teaching or learning, that we are, by nature, very complex in the ways by which we interpret our world.

When using Mapquest, I choose the map of my destination, not the directions option, if I'm generally familiar with the area. If I see a map it helps me to ""place"" my destination within the surrounding area and I can see whether it's on the NE or SW corner of an intersection in my mind's eye, for example - for my husband, N-S-E-W mean nothing to him; he selects the ""directions"" feature.As I mentioned in my FlipGrid, I had trouble learning Spanish from a CD while driving, because I couldn't *see* how the word is spelled; and so, I didn't feel I was absorbing it into deep memory. Also, in bar/restaurant type places, I need to sit with my back to the t.v. so that it doesn't draw me in; it often prevents me from focusing on those I am with, and I don't listen well to them. My auditory skills are lacking - I find I can listen to audio books really well in the morning, but don't even try at day's end; same thing with avoiding taking an aerobics class in the evening - I don't follow directions too well at this time of day, especially if I need to stay ""in sync"" with the rest of the class ;)I think my visual learning style ""fits"" with online courses - my challenge is to remain focused in an online world so full of alternate options for learning.

I think it's also beneficial to know where you may not be as strong for a learning style. For example, I know that I am not great with lecture style learning.

As I read through the lists of characteristics for each of the learning styles, I definitely associate the most with a visual learner as a student. However as a teacher, my education and years of instruction have forced me to focus on those areas in which I am not as strong and build those competencies. As I thought about myself as a learner now, I am the product of many hours in the classroom, both learning and teaching. These opportunities have pushed me to develop and grow in the areas of auditory learning and even kinesthetic learning in our activities in my pottery class.

As I pointed out in my post, I use a visual learning style when I am learning courses that are in the humanities, but for courses such as accounting and finance (that require hands-on practice) I tend to use both visual and kinesthetic learing learning styles.

Does your learning style fit with online learning?I am an auditory learner and my classes have to be quiet when I am listening. I do not like disruptions that are unnecessary. Online learning includes auditory and visual learning that are my favorites. As a teacher my classroom has to be really quiet when students are focused on work or when I am instructing the class.

R,"I have chosen complexity under the category - University. _The Welsh scholar Dave Snowden proposed cynefin complexity framework to describe a perspective on the evolutionary nature of complex systems, including their inherent uncertainty. I am interested in complexity system because I think educational system itself is a complexity system.In complexity theory an organism senses and responds to its environment, thereby changing its environment, which changes the organism again, so that the organism reacts to, and thereby _ proactively _ changes, its environment; the process, in iterating itself, produces dynamic and continuous change recursively (Stewart, 1991). _And Educational systems, institutions and practices exhibit many features of complex adaptive systems, being dynamical and emergent, sometimes unpredictable, non-linear organizations operating in unpredictable and changing external environments.The cynefin complexity framework provides a typology of contexts that guides what sort of explanations or solutions might apply. It draws on research into complex adaptive systems theory, cognitive science, anthropology, and narrative patterns, as well as evolutionary psychology, to describe problems, situations, and systems. It ""explores the relationship between man, experience, and context""and proposes new approaches to communication, decision-making, policy-making, and knowledge management in complex social environments.Educators can use this framework to evaluate the learning system or learning community. Educators and other stakeholders can use it to do knowledge management, which refers to a multi-disciplined approach to achieving organisational objectives by making the best use of knowledge. It can also be used by software developer to evaluate the quality of products. It align with the key characteristics as followings: it has real-world relevance and provides the opportunity for both instructors and students to making best use of knowledge.

I love that you can collect specific ""playlists"" that include videos, websites and other content,, organize them into a specific order, and make them publicly available to other people.One tool/website that's been really interesting for me is codeacademy.com. It's been very helpful in my career to gain technical skills to be able to work with LMSs on a more widespread and technical level. So, in terms of the key characteristics of successful learning, it definitely has real-world relevance. I think learning the basics behind web design and development is going to become more and more important for lots of people to understand, and there are a lot of young people interested in it!Codeacademy also does a great job in two other indicators of authentic learning in that it definitely allows for diverse outcomes, and learners can create polished projects. As you are learning about HTML, CSS, etc, the site actually teaches you to build projects, such as webpages, step by step. Although there are certain things you code has to have in order to work, you can be very creative in how you design a webpage, and one student's project could look entirely different from others.Codeacademy is set up as a series of tutorials where you can pick and choose which projects/skills you want to work on next. A neat feature of the site is that you can create your own tutorials to teach users of the site about how to create a project you designed, or a skill that you specialize in. This could be an interesting assignment for students to not only learn a little about web languages, but they can create a lesson to teach others. This fits with the ""provide opportunities for students to examine tasks from different perspectives"" authentic learning indicator.However, the way this learning tool is currently, it's not as strong with creating opportunities for collaboration, or integrating multiple subject areas.

I chose ""Development of the 13 Colonies"" under the Social Studies area. _Currently, I am teaching the Elementary Social Studies class for the post-bac program. _My fifth grade preservice teachers must teach about the 13 colonies under the MN Academic Standards for Social Studies. _I thought perhaps this could be a good resource for them for two reasons: a) they could learn more about this time period and b) they can see a technology tool that they could potentially use and/or create for their own students.How does the tool promote authentic learning? Specifically, how does it align with the six key characteristics of successful activities described on Page 2 of the EduCause article above? To be honest, I was reminded a bit of WebQuests when I saw this, minus the tasks, rubrics, etc. _Perhaps it was the controlling feature. _That is, if you designed this for your students you can control what websites, videos, etc. would go into it. _I see this as a great tool when you don't have a lot of time for students to do their own research, but you want to expose them to a variety of sources about a particular topic. _What I like about Lesson Paths is that you can identify the source. _In fact, you can click on it to find out more information. _For my students, I would challenge them to determine if the websites, videos, etc. within the Lesson Paths are valid and reliable sources. _This is something we constantly do in social studies. _We might also ask the purpose or bias of the source. In connection to the six key characteristics, I see them at play both if a student was simply a recipient of a Lesson Path or a creator of a Lesson Path. _However, as creators the six key characteristics become more applicable. _For example, while students could collaborate in viewing a Lesson Path such as the ""13 Colonies"" it would be up to the teacher to create the parameters of the collaboration. However, if the students were to create a Lesson Path on their own they can determine how they will collaborate with their teacher acting more as a coach._I do believe this ""13 Colonies"" allows students to ""examine a task from different perspectives, using a variety of resources."" _However, I would not simply let them go to this Lesson Path without a critical eye. _For example, National Geographic is one of the websites used in this Lesson Path (valid, reliable), but one of the videos is created by ""planoprof"" in You Tube. _In a quick search to figure out who or what ""planoprof"" is, I can't figure it out. _While the video seems OK, I am left unsure of my source, so I cannot say it is valid or reliable. _This I would argue is something the person who creates the Lesson Path ought to be concerned with.I sound like a grouch. _I really do like tool. _I'm just a stickler for checking sources. :)",1,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Week 12,1,Starter
T,"M, I really enjoy reading your posts and the sincerity you bring to your reflections. It is great to see someone so passionate leading our future teachers! I was beginning my teacher education classes back in 2001 and I remember how much WebQuests were a cutting edge thing. Now looking back on some of those things, although very rudimentary, they were extremely important to the development of the software we are using today.You also bring up a good point about checking sources and finding legitimate information. I remember being warned about Wikipedia early in those teacher education courses for the possibility of phoney information, but I would argue that it is not the case anymore. In our age of digital access and cross checking of facts by millions of people, misinformation doesn't stay long on the internet. It's an open platform that is patrolled by some very focused individuals and is constantly being updated to reflect changes that may happen within minutes of things happening like deaths, marriages, elections, statistics, or even births.Not to get sidetracked, but you bring up a very good point in students being able to identify bias when researching information. It seems like something I take for granted, but its important for our students, who are so entrenched in internet research, to recognize those things.

Not really, you would have to really stretch the idea of concepttest questions to scaffold students to consider different perspectives in responding.provide opportunity to collaborate? No, the benefit is that it allows individual student responses. I suppose the faculty could use it for some sort of think, pair, share and gather a collective response.what else?You could certainly apply this across subject matter.

Writing a resume has real-world relevance because in order to get a job, we fill out our resume and send it in to our future employers. We must know what we should and shouldn't do when filling out a resume. It also allow competing solutions and diverse outcomes because one can write their resume however they wish.

Real-world relevance: the steps outlined definitely had real world application since it would help students achieve a higher score which is the intended outcome of the course;provide opportunity for students to examine the tasks from different perspectives, using a variety of resources: the video points students to resources they might want to consult, but it does not provide those resources. _One of the things it talks about is how students can approach the SAT by using a variety of techniques to eliminate incorrect answers;provide opportunity to collaborate: it can be used to collaborate with others since it can be shared who might also be studying for the test;integrate and apply across different subject areas and lead beyond domain-specific outcomes: using a video to teach preparatory courses can be applied to many courses;create polished products valuable in their own right rather than as preparation for something else: the goal of the video was to prepare students to successfully pass the SAT exam. In that sense its intended outcome was a preparation for something else;allow competing solutions and diverse outcomes: I am sure I understand what this characteristic means.These characteristics are probably too narrowly defined to apply to teaching and learning that leads to authentic learning.

A,"Wow! I cannot believe how quickly 14 weeks flew by. This course has been so wonderful and I am so glad that I took it as an elective.At the beginning of the semester, I defined online community as: ""A group of people that share a mutual identity, whether it be race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation... [a group] comprised of people who strongly associate themselves with that group but, perhaps even more important... [requires] a true social presence. In other words, members of the group must be able to develop and convey a true sense of themselves that includes their personality, passions, interests, and emotions."" I think this definition has remained the same for me throughout the semester, but I was able to see what it actually looked like, through assignments, discussions, and online interactions. I absolutely believe our class achieved becoming a true online community. Furthermore, I think our class did a wonderful job of achieving all six ""essential"" elements discussed in Palloff & Pratt.I appreciated having a class charter and the item that I kept close to heart was being open-minded to other peoples' comments and viewing responses with a positive lens. It was really cool to see how culture shaped classmates' responses, too.I don't know that I can limit my takeaways to just 2 items, however, what I believe to be important are: 1) There is a lot of work that goes into creating an academic online community! The technology that is chosen can make or break a course, and assignments should be meaningful; and 2) I firmly believe that academic online communities are very different than non-academic online communities. I think it is easier to develop a social presence and be authentic. I believe academic online communities provide a common goal, which allows classmates to share a general purpose from the get-go.I really liked the way this course was structured. I don't think I really have any suggestions except to continue with what works well. I liked how Instructor owned the process for the first half of the semester and then we all had a chance to create assignments for our classmates. I loved looking at lots of different types of technology, and we had to explore it right off the bat. I liked that we had general discussions, as well as small groups. As a M.A.-HRIR student, I had to take 8 credits outside of my major. I stumbled across this course while searching online last semester and I am so glad that I had the opportunity to take it!Thank you to Instructor and my classmates for making this semester a wonderful one!

R,"A) ""online learning community""Through various discussions with my colleagues, I have a deeper thought of online community now. An online learning environment is not an online learning community, sometimes. The key factor of online learning community is the collaboration, communication and interaction among learners. For example, some instructors use Moodle to deliver materials and sometimes use the forum discussion function. But learners have few interactions in the forum. They just post their own thoughts. Plus, they don't have group activities. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, it is an online learning environment but it isn't an online learning community. An effective online learning community has a fundamental characteristic that is people can easily build connections and they feel comfortable to ask for help and offer help to others. They can collaboratively form an active/interdependent learning atmosphere. I think we did create an effective online learning community. I got some feedbacks from my colleagues and the instructor. But to some extent, I feel I need more connections and suggestions.B) six _essentialÓ elements In this class, I think we feel comfortable to communicate with each other. We do have a sense of safety and trust. We usually have active dialogue in both large class group discussion and in base/small group discussion. And for some topics, colleagues bring outside relevant information into this course and we also post relevant motivators each week. Those always inspire me greatly! Sometimes, I just feel I need more feedbacks and suggestions, to some extent. C) In what ways (if any) did the establishment of Participation Expectations & Interaction Guidelines shape your experiences? Actually, this is my first real online course, in my life so far. I like it and it inspires me with several new thoughts of my research and teaching. I think the most important experiences for me is that creating this guideline helps me achieve a deeper thoughts about what is an effective online learning community. We do know how to form an effective online learning community in theoretical level, but putting it into practice is another story. Ideally, I do think many actions needed to be taken in order to create a more active and effective online learning community. D) Identify 2 _take awaysÓ from the course.""Take aways"": The most important one for me is I have a new idea about my further research. I think it's a good idea to make an exploratory case study in terms of this online course. Hope it would be offered by Instructor in the following years, so I can conduct my research :)Another one is this is the first time that I know online course can be organized in so many ways, such as various kinds of group discussions, learning team facilitation activity, creating guideline together, and so forth. I will apply these ways into my online course in the future. In addition, I have learned several useful tools, such as podcast, adobe connect.E) Identify suggestions for future CI 5323 courses. We might have some synchronous online meetings, like once a month or so. This is a good way to make close connections for our community.",2,0,2,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,Week 14,1,Leader
J,"R, I really liked how you mentioned Moodle being an online learning environment not an online learning community. I completely agree with this. When I have used Moodle in the past I have only ever worried about my responses. Even when I do have to post to others it is usually a very broad response with not a lot of response (if that makes sense). I think that the community we have created on Ning has become an online learning community because we have created a place where feedback was thoughtful and not just feedback so you could get done with the assignment.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Week 14,0,Influencer

J,"Online Community:When I first started this class, I think I had a very broad definition of what an online learning community was. I think I had always had an idea of what an online community was but not particularly an online learning community. Today when I think of an online learning community I think it is a group of people coming together in a mutual group for a common goal. During an online learning community people need to respond to others respectfully and honestly while still staying true to themselves.6 Essential Elements: As the semester has gone on I think we have definitely created a great online learning community in this class. I believe in this class we have used all of the 6 essentials mentioned in the book really well. In previous online classes we haven't had as many of these essential elements met. I think one we have done particularly well was responsiveness. Each one of us has responded thoughtfully to others opinions and thoughts regarding the various lessons. While we have responded to each other we have also shown each other lots of respect as well (I think at least).Class Charter:I think the class charter gave me a good idea of what to expect and what was going to be expected of me throughout the class. I also think it gave me an idea of what others expected out of each other and the teacher. Take Aways:I think one of my biggest take away from this class has to be how much work it takes to create a positive online learning community. When we first started creating our own lessons I had no idea how much work it took to look up resources and come up with content that works with what we are learning about. I also then didn't realize how many more times you must check the website when you are in charge of the class. Another take away from this class is how important motivation is when creating an online community. In my blog I talked a lot about how much I valued being able to participate in the other community when I wanted not when I was forced too.Suggestions:I don't really have any big suggestions for future courses. I liked the way it was structured and I liked that we were able to work at our own pace with things. The only thing that I can think of would be maybe one more synchronous chat (maybe at the beginning of the year) just so people can get to know each other better.

M,"Before I begin to address Instructor's prompts, I need to admit something. _I took this class to learn how to teach online better, but I also took it because I needed the flexibility in my hectic schedule. _In the end, what motivated to participate was our conversations.Online Community:In Week 02, despite writing the longest post I have ever written for this class, I said that in order to be an authentic community we need to work at it, shifting and adjusting to meet our needs. _I'm sticking with that. _I felt like our class adjusted to our needs. _I think about all the student led weeks and how each group had us engage with various content in a variety of ways. _I think we pushed each other, but also respected each others' time, knowing we are all very busy. _I think also we began to feel more comfortable talking to one another and the conversations became more natural and, at least for me, I wanted to respond not because I had to (for my grade), but because I genuinely wanted to participate in the conversations. _So, ultimately, I believe we did create an online learning community. _I know I've said it before, but every time after going to one of my horrible f-2-f classes where the instructor did very little to create community I would think about this class and just be amazed at how much more I felt part of something in this class when I have never even met anyone in person besides R! _That says a lot.Six Essential Elements:I cannot say for sure that we met all these six elements, but I think we hit them all in different ways. _Here are my examples:honesty - I so appreciated Instructor when she'd say she had something going on and that she would post the week's information at a later time. _It made me trust her more. _If she is being this honest with us, we can be honest back. _It was like she was admitting to being, well, human. _I so appreciated that.responsiveness - Wowza! _I think of my group E, J, and L. _Somehow we managed to set up a week's worth of work and monitor it. _We did this all through a threaded discussion and Google docs. _I think we took Jonnson & Johnson's cooperative learning seriously. _We swam together! relevance - here I think of all the groups! _Everyone worked hard to make the content they taught relevant to each of us by recognizing there are a variety of learners in this class who hope to use the information in a variety of ways in their own education or professional life. respect - I will be honest in one of the threaded discussions I wondered why my post got so much ""action."" _And R can attest, I felt a little uneasy about it. _After spending a few days thinking about it, I was pretty dang proud. _Some people challenged me and asked hard questions while others agreed with me. _I think that's a strong sign of respect. _By challenging each other in kind ways it demonstrates we respect each other and want each other to think in different ways. _We come out better in the end openness - If I had to give an award for this one, I'd give it to T.In every single post of his he was positive and open to various ideas. _He was always looking for ways to connect what was being presented to his own work and even when it wasn't he saw value in just learning about it. _Kudos to T.empowerment - I will admit this is one of those words that I feel like is a great word to use with youth, but as an adult I feel like it somehow doesn't hold as much value. _This is where I think, ""you are an adult. _Suck it up and do the work."" _However, again, whenever I would attend my yucky f-2-f class and then come into this class I always felt empowered to contribute. _This is not the case in the yucky f-2-f class. _In that class sometimes I can't suck it up. _I just want to leave. _This was never ever the case in this class! Class Charter:We rocked it! _I think everyone took the development of this charter seriously and then acted accordingly. _I think this really set the tone of the class. _I made me feel more safe to take risks.Take Aways:I want to learn more about communities of practice and communities of inquiry. _I feel like this term ""community"" can be overused, so I'd like to spend more time with these two concepts and see how they may be worked into my research.Organization! _Wow. _As a teacher educator I am always watching how others teach. _I am convinced that Instructor is the most organized person on the planet. _I'm also convinced that online teaching takes more time, energy and commitment than f-2-f. _I've always cringed when people say, ""oh it's online so it'll be easier."" _I think there is this commonsense notion that b/c you could be in your pajamas at home or in a cafe while in your online class, it's easier. _To those folks, I say take an online class (one that others say is excellent), then let's talk! Suggestions:If there was a way to maybe meet synchronously earlier in the class and again at the end, that would be great! _I think then we'd have a better sense of the types of community that gets built in synchronous vs. asynchronous. _Stick with Ning!! _Oh, was I so happy not to be in Moodle. _Thank you! _Oh, and keep the motivators. _There were times I really needed the silly videos or quotes.Burning Questions I have none. _Thank you for a great class everyone!",2,1,1,2,0,1,0,6,0,0,Week 14,1,Leader

B,"A. Online Communities in week 2:I really enjoyed going back and looking at my thoughts in week 2.  After reading my comments I feel that they are still true and important.  Online communities to me are a group of people who gather together from a variety of places to learn, share, reflect, or experience something.  Rather that be education like in our case, or how to be a more effective parent, or better runner.  As I stated in week 2, I have been an online learner for the past three years.  I have really enjoyed my courses but feel that this course has really taught me about a true online community.The connections, and interactions that have been shown in this course have not always been their for me in other courses.  This has truly been an amazing experience. B, Six Elements:I would say in my experience that all 6 areas from the Pratt and Palloff reading were meet in this course. Honesty: I felt that Instructor lead the way throughout this course and shared her thoughts, and feelings.  She was honest with the group about herself and I think that opened the door for us as students to follow and feel comfortable sharing about us.  I also feel that each member of this class shared ""honest"" posts and responses.They shared feed back that gave the group different view points and talking points.Responsiveness: I feel all members did a nice job of responding to posts and thoughts in a timely manner.Respect: Again I think that Instructor took the lead and has always been respectful of our time, busy days, families and other courses.  Respect has been shown in out deadlines, feedback and out all feel of the class. Openness: I have really been impressed with the amount of ""openness"" that has been shown.I think that everyone has felt that they can share there thoughts and opinions in this safe community.Empowerment: As stated in the reading online communities ""empower"" students to take their learning farther.  I has been a great experience to take this learning and apply it during our week of teaching.  That exercise really helped me to gain my ""empowerment"" that I could do this in my work place.C. I really liked the Charter.  It was a great way to start the course so we all understood the expectations and responsibilities.  We all had a chance to make suggestions which helped to make the course our own. I also think that it does a nice job of leveling the playing field.  You gave all members a chance to share, and laid out the expectations so that we were all on the same page.D. Two take away:For me the first take away is how much work, effort, information, reflection and time goes into online classes.  I hope to be able to someday offer an ECFE class online for busy parents.  This class has helped me gain a better understanding of way it takes for it to be successful.  During our teaching week and in the weeks that's leading up to our week, there was a lot of prep work that needed to be done and a lot of follow up.The second take away is the importance of really creating a community.  Allowing people to share their thoughts, ideas, experiences, and feelings allows for try and interesting learning to take place. I loved all the difference technology that was used, allowing for people to not only learn new technology but to use pieces that they were comfortable with. I enjoyed the voice threads for longer posts, and the flipgrid for short thoughts.I think that laying out the expectation at the start of the course allows learners to understand where we are going. E. This has truly been one of my favorite courses.  I signed up because I needed 2 more credits and I needed them to be online.  I am leaving the course a much better online students. I enjoyed the group assignment, and the weekly motivators were super cool. I would have enjoyed one more live online chat, maybe in the middle of the course.  It is a nice way to connect in an all online course.F.

S,"How have your conceptions shifted, remained the same? Did we create an online learning community?I guess when I began this course, I was thinking of online learning communities more as voluntary sites (like communities of practice) where anyone could go to ask questions, receive a variety of answers/resources from a wide variety of participants of the site; I wasnêt really thinking of them in terms of how we would come to use our Ning course site in this course, as formally enrolled students of an online learning community. But Iêve come to see that there are a wide variety of such online learning communities, and we have definitely formed one in this course _ even going so far as to learn together how to work in groups at a distance, both synchronously and asynchronously, and with great success. I have also found myself wanting to share the key aspects of these communities with my colleagues, who are being asked to develop online learning opportunities for the courses they teach F2F _ particularly, the need to develop that social presence, to engage learners effectively (many are thinking only in terms of loading content online, in the beginning). So, I would have to say that my conceptions of online learning have shifted considerably, due to my involvement in this course. Six Essential Elements: honesty, responsiveness, relevance, respect, openness, empowerment. Where did this class succeed? Fall short? I feel that as an instructor, Instructor very effectively modeled how we should incorporate these essential elements into this community: by conveying her thoughts and challenges as an instructor very honestly (for example, her reaction to the vaccination precluding her from capturing herself in the video of our final weekês assignment); we were encouraged to participate through being responsive to those in the class with us, by contributing unique & relevant content to the discussions (learning in groups produces far more knowledge than learning solo); the class charter reinforced these ideals, as well as that of responding respectfully to our classmatesê contributions. We were asked to be open, and did so, I would say. And as the instructor, Instructor empowered us to explore beyond the content covered in the syllabus, to complete assignments on our own schedule, as adult learners with competing life demands, yet giving us time _goalsÓ in which to complete things. All of these elements were encouraged in this class, at a level appropriate to us as adult learners, I feel. As far as falling short, I mayêve missed the timelines on a few of the goal dates for completion, but I donêt feel the course itself fell short in any areas. These online distance learning courses, to me, actually _set the barÓ for this type of instruction. And they have helped me immeasurably in the work that I do.In what ways (if any) did the establishment of a class charter shape your experiences?I feel that a community charter is essential, to outline for members what is expected from them, as far as contributions to the group, and also what they can expect from other members. As I plan to develop such an online community of practice in the near future, I can see that a charter will be essential to the process, especially as it clearly defines member expectations and gives me something to refer to, if I need to ask someone to leave the community for poor behavior, etc.Identify 2 _take awaysÓ from the course. One big take-away for me was the realization of just how much work it is to develop a course for online distribution; I remember Instructor saying that, as an instructor in online teaching, you must have the whole course completed in advance, because of the day-to-day demands of supporting the learners, once it is underway. In this way, online teaching is more demanding than F2F (though perhaps more rewarding, too). A second take-away is the importance of authenticity and building of the social presence in online communities because, without this, no trust is built and the interactions become more guarded, and may likely diminish rather than flourish.Identify suggestions for future CI 5323 courses.Just a comment, I guess: I felt that the workload for this course was more manageable, somehow, than that for CI5325; perhaps this was because I had far more work/personal demands last semester; but it seemed that in CI5325 there were many more hours needed to complete assignments. This observation may also relate to my early fascination with all of the potential in online learning, and I mayêve struggled more in resisting the urge to follow any & all links within our readings, etc. Time management in this curiosity-piquing environment will remain a challenge for me, I feel. This personal challenge may also relate to the new _opennessÓ which this learning environment offers, in general _ when I went through my formal high school and undergrad education, the material beyond that which was assigned was very limited; and to seek out more information on a given topic usually involved a trip to the library during their set hours, and mayêve been limited only to what they had on their shelves/in print. So, this perception of the workload discrepancy between 5325 & 5323 may simply be due to my digital immigrant status here.

R's Presi _ I liked that the learner activities which include social presence, collaboration, interactions, reflective/transformative learning seemed to fit what Iêve experienced through this class.Mês point about making the distinction between _presenceÓ and _quality interactions.ÓHow have your conceptions shifted, remained the same? In week 2, I had thought reflection was going to be one of the trickiest things to include in an online community (based on my past experience as a student of online classes and as an evaluation observer for face-to-face science courses). However, Instructor provided many different activities that embedded reflection as part of the learning (e.g. online community blog or discussion questions that required self-reflection or group reflection). By the time we got to our learning team assignments, it seemed to be second nature to include some aspect of reflection in the learning activity. This final summative assignment characterizes the type of learning that this class has fostered. My conception has shifted to think of reflection as forgotten by many instructors but not necessarily tricky if it permeates the nature of the assignments and class structure.Did we create an online learning community? Absolutely, this class modeled for me a better understanding of the community of inquiry model with members having definite social presence, striking the right balance of teacher presence, and all of it feeding the cognitive presence to make a transformative learning experience on multiple levels. For me the learning from this class changed from being about just reading about ideas to experiencing what these ideas might mean in our own learning context.B) Palloff & Pratt offer six _essentialÓ elements that are important to online learning: honesty, responsiveness, relevance, respect, openness, empowerment.Where did this class succeed? I think that our class succeeded in most of these elements. Earlier in the book Palloff & Pratt discussed the the idea of a conscious community with established norms and where trust is built. I think that some of the introductory assignments in the first weeks helped us establish our norms and with it honesty, openness, and respect. In Lês illustration in week 2 _ this was our _safe spaces.Ó I also think that team learning assignment gave us more empowerment. By that point in the course, responsiveness was as much for our own learning as well as feeling responsible that our responsiveness was necessary for the learning of others and wanting everyone to have a great experience.Fall short? _The only area where it was sometimes challenging was _relevance.Ó I think with our groupês varied experiences it was difficult to find different ways for the material to always be relevant. I know that my own team learning assignment we struggled with offering enough materials to engage with everyoneês interests.C) In what ways (if any) did the establishment of Participation Expectations & Interaction Guidelines shape your experiences? [Class Charter document linked in the left column on Ning]I think the process of creating the class charter was useful in coming to a common understanding of expectations. It helped establish some respectful norms, such as using each othersê first names in posts. Little things like that made the experience feel more real and establish the sense of trust early. I think if you had registered for the course hoping it would be just a filler then you would know early on that this was not going to work and that your fellow participants expected much from each other _ it wasnêt instructor driven.D) Identify 2 _take awaysÓ from the course.Learning about the community of inquiry model for me was huge _particularly because we covered it early in the semester, I have continued to reflect on it in my own professional life and in this course.The range of tools and learning strategies used in this course and having the safe space to try them out _ flipgrid, voicethread, presi, scribble art, secondlife.E) Identify suggestions for future CI 5323 courses.It would have been nice to have had an activity later in the term where we had to visit everyoneês blog discussion or their page. I didnêt think of this when we were organizing our team learning activity.

M,"E,Oh, I like the idea of checking out each other's blogs.  I too didn't think about that.  I did a quick look at some folk's blogs and people were doing all kinds of things.  I think having a discussion around our individual online communities would have been interesting and enriching.  This could maybe also get at the relevance piece you said may need some boosting.  Perhaps the discussion could revolve around why you joined the community you did, what you get out of it, etc.  Perhaps too we could use this to discuss communities of practice vs. communities of inquiry",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Week 14,0,Leader

O,"A) How have your conceptions shifted, remained the same? Did we create an online learning community?My thoughts about what an online learning community are were very vague at the beginning of the semester. This class has really given me a concrete theoretical understanding and practical example of what an online learning community is because we were learning about the theory as we were creating a community ourselves. One major way in which my thinking has changed is about the importance of creating community in an online class. I think before this class, it's something that I wouldn't have realized is extremely important in an online learing experience. But now having had such a positive experience in this class, and having really enjoyed this community-based online learning, I couldn't imagine an online class without community.B) Palloff & Pratt offer six _essentialÓ elements that are important to online learning: honesty, responsiveness, relevance, respect, openness, empowerment. Where did this class succeed? Fall short? I felt like all of these elements were present in our class, but the one that really sticks out to me is responsiveness. I felt like, by and large, our class was very participatory and I always felt like when I logged on there would be new comments and conversations, particularily in response to my own posts. I think Instructor did a great job of setting this up early in the semester when she responded to everyone's VoiceThreads in the first week of class. That set the tone for me that my comments would be noticed and responded to, which made me feel like it was a worthwhile thing to make comments in the first place! I also really appreciated everyone's respectfulness and friendliness in responding to each other's post - it felt safe to give one's actual thoughts. C) In what ways (if any) did the establishment of Participation Expectations & Interaction Guidelines shape your experiences?I think creating the Participation Expecations & Interaction Guidelines at the very beginning of the semester is a total stroke of genius. It gets everyone on the same page, it's something almost everyone can have an opinion on and have something to comment about, and it feels more ""grassroots"" rather than a top-down approach to classroom norms, which is a nice thing for adult education. Getting a say in what the expectation and guidelines are made me feel more invested in the community. At the very beginning, we were able to start to see each other's personalities, as well as our comfort, experience, and concerns about online education. For a class that wasn't specifically about creating online communities, perhaps it's not something you would be able to spend as much time as we did on it, but I think it was an extremely important step in our own classroom community.D) Identify 2 _take awaysÓ from the course.a) One thing I will remember from this course about creating online learning communities is the importance of providing spaces within the community for both academic and non-academic discussion. In our class the non-academic discussion was the weekly motivators - a place where we could bring in things that were interesting, inspirational, or funny. If the online space doesn't leave any room to talk about anything other than class, well that just isn't as much fun! b) Also related to the weekly motivators, another take away for building community is balancing control between the instructor/facilitator and the learners. After the first couple of weeks, the weekly motivators were a part of our online experience that Instructor let us shape on our own. The student-led weeks of classes were also important for building community also. A genuine community needs to live and grow on its own - if the activity is solely dictated by the instructor, then it doesn't feel as genuine. By giving up direct control for a few weeks, it felt more like the class's community, rather than a community forced by the instructor. E) Identify suggestions for future CI 5323 courses. I think it probably depends on the instructor for how comfortable they feel doing this (and how comfortable the class feels with each other and the instructor), but I really like this idea of spending a week at the end of class to talk over what they learned, and what they found useful or not. For myself, I feel really comfortable with this class, and also with Instructor, to speak my own thoughts and give feedback. F) Additional questions?Hmm...I can't think of any!",1,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,0,0,Week 14,1,Regular
R,"O, I like your opinion: ""A genuine community needs to live and grow on its own - if the activity is solely dictated by the instructor, then it doesn't feel as genuine."" I agree that the student-led weeks of classes were also important for building community. One of the reasons that it works is because we are graduate students and we are more self-directed.

T,"A)You each defined or envisioned ""online community"" or ""online learning communityÓ at the beginning of the semester. _Revisit your thoughts (as well as those of your course colleagues) posted in the Week 02 discussion forum. _How have your conceptions shifted, remained the same? Did we create an online learning community?I donêt think that I was really able to completely comprehend the true extent of _online learning communitiesÓ in the beginning. My understanding of an online community was very limited in scope at the beginning, but has evolved into something very vibrant and organic. If someone told me that I would have felt such an attachment to a group of people, who I would not meet f2f during the course of this class, I would have thought they were crazy. Although the text supported the possibility to establish the strong learning community we enjoyed, there was still some apprehension in my mind. It must be the eternal cynic in me. There is no doubt in my mind that we created an online learning environment. A common thread that flows through many other responses to this questions comes back to the comments each of us have left in the discussion forums, the interactions in small groups, and the way in which we make connections between each other. This was, in many ways, more rewarding than many of my f2f courses.B) Palloff & Pratt offer six _essentialÓ elements that are important to online learning: honesty, responsiveness, relevance, respect, openness, empowerment. Where did this class succeed? Fall short? Honesty _ There was a certain human element that was present in this class that I donêt see very often in education. It was the recognition of life, family, career, and obligations that affect our ability to do something. If there was follow through required, it was completed, and if there was a question, it was answered. Responsiveness _ The ability to work within smaller group whether it was the first learning group or our facilitation team was amazing. Earlier in our text it discussed people falling into rolls within a group and this was key to both of my groups finding success, as well as each member feeling personally responsible for the content and their contributions.Relevance _ The facilitation weeks were a great example of this and every group found ways in which to make the content relevant to each person. Specifically, the Lesson Paths website that S located for our team, gave each person something they could actually use and build upon for future use without being a time waster.Respect _ I was shocked at how cordial most of our conversations were in the discussion forums. In the Palloff & Pratt texts they warned us of tension and possible arguments, but I wonder if it was due to our silent recognition of a _Minnesota niceÓ mindset. I didnêt particularly want to see conflict, but it was interesting that nothing seemed to surface in our community. I think it was the level of professional commitment and respect from all parties that wanted the best for each and every person in our discussions, teams, and flipgrid responses.Openness _ This is what really hooked me into the course. When I was making my way through the Voicethread introductions it was not easy to find commonalities between my classmates and myself. However as the course went on, I felt that the material we covered was something I had some knowledge of and connection to in my short time teaching high school art. In other facets of the course, I was constantly encouraged by Instructor and S, when life became overwhelming with my kids and school, with encouraging comments and shared life stories so similar to mine. I knew if I had their support, I was in the right place!Empowerment _ I just had a conversation with my wife about this time in life has been a perfect time for me to go back and complete a masters program. At this point in my career I have exhausted what I learned as an undergrad, explored new things, found my own voice, and now I am coming back to _fill my cup.Ó This was truly an empowering experience as I was exposed to so much information that I wouldnêt have located on my own. It was refreshing to be a student again where I am can work on refining my teaching, incorporating new ideas, and exploring ways in which I can prepare my students for an evolving post-secondary opportunity. C) In what ways (if any) did the establishment of Participation Expectations & Interaction Guidelines shape your experiences? As this was my first true _online course and online communityÓ I relied heavily on the class charter to outline expectations and illustrate what I would be expected to do. Balancing so many more things than I would have in a f2f course, it was crucial that I managed my time and worked on a fairly structured schedule in order to complete everything within the given timelines. The discussion that followed the drafting process was also very interesting for my to observe. Everyone contributed to the discussion and brought up great points and sparked more conversation. It was a tremendously rewarding brainstorming process to watch. Lastly, although I didnêt go back to it that often as the class was underway, I was aware of its existence and took it to heart that it was a document we all contributed too. D) Identify 2 _take awaysÓ from the course.Like many of my classmates I think that _take awaysÓ from this course are greater than two, however a couple of this things I am thinking about right now include:1.Building relationships are extremely important in developing online communities. It may seem obvious, but in our day and age, our connection to another human seem to be moving farther and farther apart. This course allowed me to get to know 20 perfect strangers better than I have known 20 classmates before. _I often take it for granted that my students know each other in my class and that getting to know them only benefits me, but the relationships they build working in groups can follow them all four years. This year I have been working on doing more group mixers and _people bingoÓ type activities. Even if just for a moment, these students are forced to meet someone new and talk about themselves.2.Structure. Being exposed to the formulaic approach to building community within an online course was validating for me. There is not magic bullet, but an approach supported by research and illustrated with great success in this course and facilitated by Instructor so succinctly. Exposure to multiple means of communication in the way of asynchronous discussion forums, videos posts through Flipgrid, screencasts, podcasts, and synchronous meetings in Adobe Connect were all relevant in bringing it all back to this underlying structure of successful execution of online courses and the communities that exist in that framework.E) Identify suggestions for future CI 5323 courses.One suggestion someone else posed was a synchronous meeting at the beginning of the course. I thought that the current format and pacing of the course was excellent and I hate to try to fix something that isnêt broken, but it might be an interesting addition.F) Are there any burning questions that you did not get answered this semester that you would like to pose for the group?I think the one burning question for me, more so of a guiding question is: where does my responsibility come in preparing and exposing my students to this content in preparation for their future studies? I have brought this up before as I am searching to find a foothold in K-12 education as so much research focuses on adults and distance learning. This is a very complex time in education with teacher evaluations being mandated by the state, with courses swelling to nearly 40 students, and to top it all off the pressure to adopt new technology without a firm platform on which to support it (1-1 iPads coming soon to our middles school). Although this reality scares the hell out of me, it does offer some opportunities to think creatively in our approach to education and may encourage that paradigm shift we so desperately need.",0,9,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,Week 14,1,Regular
M,"Hi T,To address your comments in F, I have seen some amazing use of iPads at Ramsey Middle School in Minneapolis.  I've only seen it in social studies, but I have to tell you it's like it's no big deal.  These kids simply use their iPads as if it were just another tool.  Until I saw this, 1-to-1 seemed like an impossible task.  I would suggest that your school ask to see strong examples of teachers using the iPads with students so you can see the possibilities.  It was amazing to watch these kids and their teachers use the iPads because like I said, it seemed so natural and seamless.  Good luck!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Week 14,0,Leader

Our district has a one-to-one initiative for middle school and high school students just this year (with teachers having only a one year jump start).

With our reading about theories of adult learning a week ago, I was thinking about all the challenges are district has faced with students being so much more distracted with the technology and parents feeling so helpless to support them in their learning.

These kids will be coming, iPads in hand, in a year and we have virtually no idea how to approach this elephant in the room. I have talked to Instructor about this and I feel like although there is quite a maturity gap between adults and a 15 year old, there is hope! Our faculty attended presentations given by a select group of 10th graders last friday and it was awkward to say the least. The students misinterpretation of knowledge vs. information was alarming. When asked by another teacher what they would do to prevent kids from using these devices as a youtube delivery system, they could only recommend locking these devices down. That seems like the opposite of what we should be doing. We give them this powerful learning tool along with rigid restrictions and limitations! Seems like a mixed message to me.I am much to young to be this cynical already:-) This course has encouraged me to be part of the discussion and not the mob that fights every step of the way.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Week 14,0,Regular
G,"Online community revisited It was interesting to go back and see what I had originally written at the start of class. My thoughts about online community during week two consisted of four main areas: presence, exchange, activity level, and contribution. Looking back over the semester, I would stick with those same four areas. My conceptions about being a participant in an online community have largely stayed the same. I strongly believe that we did create an online learning community this semester. Six elements honesty: as we got to know one another better, we became more comfortable posting responses that contradicted others' opinions.responsiveness: our group was a lively one, and the responses were within the time frames established by Instructor and weekly facilitators. And at times, if others were not able to contribute by a particular time, we knew they were ""good for it"" and would respond.relevance: we had a range of experiences and perspectives in the group, which was evident in the discussion responses. Sometimes it can be difficult to see how one person's experience or career focus pertains to your own, and I found value in reading and listening to where each person was coming from (as opposed to trying to figure out how it might apply to my personal situation).respect: when we did have opinions that differed from one another's, we could state our differences in a respectful manner. Disagree with ideas, not people.openness: Instructor set the tone for open communication, and that precedent encouraged us to do the same. I experienced this in both small group activities (the initial learning groups and our week-long facilitation assignment).empowerment: as we became more confident in navigating around the Ning site and using various pieces of technology, that is empowering, and can encourage us to put ourselves out there in other ways. It was fun to read when others successfully figured out how to do something - go us :) Class charter The process of creating the class charter helped me to approach the course from a more holistic perspective - more so than other courses I've taken where the co-creation process has not happened. It helps, for me as a learner, to situate myself within the larger course context and think about not only what I can gain but what I might be able to give in return. I have taken one other course previously in which we did a similar activity, and it shapes the class from the start in a different way (than just reading over the syllabus on the first day for example) - it brings a communal focus to the learning space.Take-aways from the course The biggest take-away from this course is the intentionality that needs to be a part of teaching and learning online. I found the text to be incredibly valuable. It walked us through the pre-work stages of an online course (setting up a reflection space, forums, etc) and then considerations for when the course went live and issues that may arise. Instructor then showed us at each step of the course how that looks. She made it seem easy! The second take-away is not directly related to our content material, but something that out in many of the discussions. One of the ideas that I have been starting to think about over the course of the semester is the experience of online learning from the perspective of the learner and the facilitator. How would the online learning space decision look from each of those perspectives? This started during some of the initial discussions in which folks were talking about the differences b/w Moodle and Ning, which prompted me to think more about LMSs in general. Also, moving to a new role professionally has given me a different view of it. Future CI 5323 courses:I'm thinking about the online community assignment...I'm going back and forth between wanting to have some participation/feedback for that assignment, and just having be more of a solitary reflection space. On one hand, it was nice to have a space to reflect on not only our other learning community and make connections to the course material. On the other hand, I was more motivated to participate in the discussion forums as I like talking and interacting with others :) I visited others' postings, as sometimes I needed a model for a response (so thank you, everyone, for that) and I was also just curious to see the ideas that others came up with for that assignment. Burning questions/last comments: I don't have any burning questions at this point, but as a final comment, I hope that as many people as possible are able to attend the LT event next Friday. I have greatly enjoyed our online conversations this semester, and it would be fun to talk and meet up in person as well.Take care everyone.

H,"A) ""Online communities can be creative, serious, fun, energetic, and much more which makes it fun to learn!""I also loved how F shared a simple wheel with characteristics including: Interaction, Community, Collaboration, Learning, and Motivation. _I would have to say my conceptions stayed the same from the beginning of this class until now. _I still believe online community is a way to engage socially, emotionally, cognitively, and respectfully with colleagues and your instructor. _The more comfortable you feel in an online community the better learning outcomes!!! _I do believe we did create an online learning community. _I feel I learned from my colleagues just as much as I did from reading text and/or surfing the net for information. _I was able to learn in a variety of styles that meet my needs. _I still have a lot to learn, but that is to be expected.B) Six essentials: All six essentials, I feel were present some stronger than others, but all present. _Openness Respect and Empowerment are three that stand out for me. _The group I was in allowed me to express my thoughts, and with ""respect"" they either encouraged my thoughts or respectfully redirected them in a positive manner. _I felt empowered as I began to research out my part in our group. _I felt my Leadership was respected and ""listened"" to. _The team did a great job in taking Leadership in different areas and when we blended them _together we were able to establish meaningful content. _I feel this course allowed for all of us to empower ourselves with new roles and responsibilities with in the learning content.The only area that may appear weaker would be the honesty and possibly relevance. _The relevance would only pertain to my self as I am not an online instructor, however I was able to gain some personal insight as I now have shifted in my job and I am learning Black Board. _This is required, as I may use this technology to give presentations to programs who do not have funds to travel for training. _Honesty is just one that, I feel would be hard to detect. _I feel the majority of my online course are honest conversations, but I have no way of proving that, so I will just have to go with the fact that the content is real and people are genuinely providing me with constructive criticisms with good intentions in mind :) .C) I am not sure if it shaped my experiences, as I have been in may online courses and I understand the responsibility of online courses. _I agree with all the expectations and guidelines, I feel they are appropriate and fair. _In face to face courses there are days where you are absent and with online you have the ability to catch up on course work even if you miss or skip a day of class. _:). _When you are in full participation you will then get the full benefits of the content. _What you put in you will get out. _Some courses will require more or less in this area, but again the amount of depth is more important than the amount of days on line or days in class. _Sometimes I find myself reading colleagues content and then forget to post responses and I continue to read and read.D). My take away is the fact that I can be so far geographically, yet continue to learn from so many people. _I feel I got to learn more about myself this go around. _I learned content, and I will probably read our text book over again, but this time I feel I learned more about my learning style and gained more confidence in technology. _Each class I gain more and more confidence. _This time I was able to read other people saying ""I don't know how to post such and such"" _I was able to say, ""I can I can -I just learned that last class "" that was a great feeling.My job is very difficult and time consuming as I have to travel so much so I really needed to figure out my learning style so I can learn to ""keep up"" in class. _I felt emotionally and socially connected this go around because I am learning to understand online pace as much as what tools are most efficient for my ""time"". _The online community I choose to join helped me to stay connected to colleagues from work and mutual colleagues with in the same field, however I was not able to put in the time the way i would have liked to. _Linkiden is a great resource and I will continue to stay connected, but I do have a hard time as I feel it can be time consuming. _My biggest take away is what I learned about myself. _:) ( I am so selfish) _lolE) WOW suggestions, _I am not sure. _This had a bit of everything!!!! I was able to post a motivator, be on a team, and do individual learning??? _NOT sure what else there would be. _I would possibly suggest to add a couple more synchronous meetings. _Have two groups of 12 _or even smaller for 45 minutes to get a more personal feel of the content and the students. _I know when I am in a synchronized session and people are giving each other smiles :) or * it is immediate feedback and it can make participants feel good about what they are saying. _It's fast pace, but it is useful.F) I just want to say that even though I did not respond to everyone's posting, I am sure I read them!!! _Sometimes you read and learn, but don't always have something to say??!!

D,"A) You each defined or envisioned ""online community"" or ""online learning communityÓ at the beginning of the semester. _Revisit your thoughts (as well as those of your course colleagues) posted in the Week 02 discussion forum. _How have your conceptions shifted, remained the same? Did we create an online learning community?Before taking this course, I supposed an online community was kind of a forum, questions and answers, posts and responses€ My conception shifted a lot, and added a number of new elements. As chapter 11 says, there are six essential elements in an online learning environment: honesty, responsiveness, relevance, respect, openness, and empowerment. We met criteria of all these six to some extent, so I do believe we created an online learning community.B) Palloff & Pratt offer six _essentialÓ elements that are important to online learning: honesty, responsiveness, relevance, respect, openness, empowerment. Where did this class succeed? Fall short? From my experience during the semester, I think this class succeeded in all of these six essential elements, especially in responsiveness and respect. Interaction between learners, and learners and instructor facilitates learning in the online environment. The forum of weekly discussion on Ning provides us a place to post thoughts and view and respond to other membersê, and it was always quite active and had quantities of posts and feedbacks there. Moreover, in our online community, I feel that I am being respected as a person, am an equal participant in the learning process, and am an expert of my own learning with some gentle guidance from instructor.C) In what ways (if any) did the establishment of Participation Expectations & Interaction Guidelines shape your experiences? [Class Charter document linked in the left column on Ning]Establishing guidelines as a starting point in an online course serves as a means by which the group defines shared goals and purpose. And the process of negotiation of guidelines, based on direction from instructor, is an empowering and mutual learning experience. The most important thing is Participation Expectations & Interaction Guidelines makes it clear what we could expect to reap from the course, what our responsibilities are, and also some boundaries of sharing personal information and others.D) Identify 2 _take awaysÓ from the course.One thing that I have a mighty impression is the development of social presence, which is a very beginning step of building an online community. Comparing my experience in our community, Ning, and my own community, I am aware of the crucial role social presence playing in an online community. When well-built, social presence does boost the communication, interaction, and cooperation among community members; otherwise, people will be reluctant to share knowledge, thoughts and experience with ones they have no idea who they are.And another take away, it might not be called take away I think, it is a thought correction. I used to believe online course was a good replacement of face-to-face class, due to its reduction of use of sites, time for transportation, and human resources. After a whole semester study, it proved I was wrong, an online course requires much more input of time and energy from instructor to read studentsê posts and give feedbacks than a traditional face-to-face class, and also has a demand of technical support for the CMS, tools, and more.E) Identify suggestions for future CI 5323 courses.I am thinking about the choice of topics for Learning Team Facilitation. I admit itês pretty open to let us make decisions according to our interests, passion, or career background, and offer us a great opportunity to experience organizing an online course, however these jumpy themes made me a little maladjusted and wonder the relation between the topics and our course. Maybe we could ask teams to pick their favorite chapter in the textbook and organize activities for that, or maybe not.F) Are there any burning questions that you did not get answered this semester that you would like to pose for the group?Nono, I canêt call to mind any one.",0,3,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,Week 14,1,Regular
N,"Summative Course Reflection & Assessment At the beginning of the course I defined an online leaning community as _a destination on the Internet where the needs of members are addressed through individual-to-individual sharing of knowledge and informationÓ. Clearly, my definition has now become expansive after our 14 weeks of working together in this course. We have grown together as an online learning community as the professor has helped us to foster the learning needs of each of us. We accomplished our learning goals through a variety of approaches including assigned readings from Instructor, blogging our thoughts on what we have learned from the community we joined, as well as team facilitation from our fellow classmates. I also think we have grown to know each other better, and this has helped us to feel a sense of belonging.Without exaggeration, I want to say this has been the most enjoyable online course I have taken. I am not saying this to curry favor with the Instructor, but I have taken many online courses and none can compare to the experience I have had in this course. On reflection, I believe several key elements contributed to the enhanced learning that I am taking away from this course. It is not the content of the course itself that I like, but how much the professor has worked to provide immediate and constant feedback. She has shown tremendous amount of respect in interacting with us: commenting on our discussions as well as in providing assessment on assigned tasks. Of all the six elements described by Pallot and Pratt as essential to fostering online learning, it is my opinion that this course met all of them.If I could suggest future _improvementsÓ to the course, it would be these. I would have liked Instructor to provide _summary lecturesÓ on each of the topics covered, which could include materials outside of the required text. The outside materials could include journal articles addressing the theory of online learning community. As much as I liked Pallot and Pratt, I think the material was light on the theoretical underpinnings of online learning. Moreover, in lieu of team facilitation I would have liked research papers to develop studentsê ability to gather and report on research. Other than these, I donêt see the need for further improvement on this course.Thanks everyone!",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Week 14,1,Peripheral

F,"Before I answer the questions, I'd like to thank everyone for being such terrific classmates, and Instructor for her tremendous insight and hard work. This has been a fascinating course, and I'm very glad I took it.A) Online Learning Community Revisited.Back in week two, my concept of an online learning community was€conceptual. I looked at it from outside and talked about how it might function, _When an online community really works, perhaps it can draw its participants back inside again and again in the same way as a (brick&mortar) student hangout€ the sort of environment that feels appealing, supportive, and challenging, so that students develop the intrinsic motivation to log on often‹to see our friends and colleagues and learn something new from each other.ÓNow, I have a more experiential understanding of it. I think the aspect of having a shared goal has risen in importance relative to the other characteristics, but on the whole, the concept remains very similar‹itês just that itês been proven. At least from my perspective, we did build an online learning community in this class. And thatês the difference. When the class started, I had theories. Now I have memories.B) Six elements. I think our greatest successes were in responsiveness, respect and empowerment. But we seemed to do a good job with relevance, too, and to genuinely strive for honesty and openness. We revealed enough of ourselves to know each other but not so much as to impose upon each other. Our discussions moved out of the strictly necessary answers to Instructorês questions and took on a life of their own. I learned a great deal from the forums that I could not have learned otherwise. I looked forward to what people would say‹actually developed intrinsic motivation to drop in. C) The Guide. I confess I didnêt revisit the document very much‹maybe once‹during the semester, but I found the process of creating it together very valuable. It gave me a clear idea of how we all were approaching the class, and allowed as a group to agree on expectations and norms at the outset. I have rarely had the opportunity to participate so fully in the development of a class culture (at least outside of writersê workshops). It was a task we could all jump into and work together on right away, and it helped us get to know each other.D) Take-aways. The first two that come to mind are: 1) Building an online community takes conscious effort and yields dividends in student participation and satisfaction. This assertion is supported both by my experience in this class and also on the articles and book chapters I read. And 2) creating online community can be done‹itês not a mysterious swamp of indefinable goo. Techniques and strategies exist that humans can employ that will lead somewhat reliably to forming a cohesive group who can work and learn together. Toward this end, it seems effective to approach community from several angles, using several project types and tools, and to provide community-building opportunities throughout the course.E) Suggestions. It might be nice to meet synchronously two or three more times to help students get more comfortable with synchronous meeting tools. It might be nice to offer optional in-person meetings, as well, although that might alter the dynamics too much by pulling some folks much closer together. Still, it might be worth exploring.F) Burning questions. The questions Iêd like to explore were planted in my brain early on in this course: what are the affordances of F2F learning? Which, if any, are unique? What are the affordances of online learning? Which, if any, are unique? How do those two sets compare? How might instructors respond?",1,2,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,Week 14,1,Starter

C,"Hi Everyone - Sorry I'm a bit late to the discussion. It's been a pleasure hanging out with you all this semester. Best of luck to everyone in the future.Online Community:I went back to my original comments and I am still in agreement with my original thoughts. I expressed that an online community is one that builds collaboration among its members and that active participation, the forming of a shared identity, and the establishment of a social network is key to forming a strong community. I also go back and looks at B's comment that ""What I love about online communities is that it brings together a group of people who may never have connected."" This is certainly the case in this class...we've all been able to connect with people we'd otherwise not had the opportunity to connect with. This though, could also be said for a face to face class, but I won't argue the differences here. :) I do agree we created an online community throughout our 15 weeks together and for the most part, created an effective engaging community. Essential Elements:The class succeeded in the following elements: honesty (people were very willing to provide insights, experiences, ideas, arguments, reflections in the responses and dialogue), respect (overall, I think everyone felt respected with each other and among each other. People provided their own opinions on various topics, but did so in a respected manner) and empowerment (I feel for the most part, people were empowered to say what they thought, even if there was disagreement on the table. I didn't notice any issues in how people communicated their ideas online). I do feel we fell slightly short in responsiveness, relevance, and openness. Responsiveness is a tough one to completely succeed in, especially in only 15 weeks of class...not everyone is responsive online. Sometimes it can take people awhile to respond to comments and ideas (I am certainly one those that wasn't always responsive immediately). I guess it also depends on how you define responsiveness. I think as a group, we can always do better in this area. Relevance is also a difficult one, as the topics aren't always relevant to everyone. Most of the conversations, though, stayed on topic, and did a good job of highlights the importance and relevance to online learning, but I still think it's an area to improve upon. Finally, I felt that people were honest, but not always completely open. As a group, we could do a better job to create a more open atmosphere to share experiences, etc. Class Charter:The class charter was helpful at the beginning of the course, as it helped me think about the course and expectations between participants and Instructor. But, thinking about how much I reviewed the charter after the first few weeks, it was minimal. And maybe that's OK, but to be honest, I didn't use the charter much after the first few weeks. Take Aways:I took away the importance of how to build and design an effective online community that focuses on collaboration and interaction. I also really enjoyed each of the week's topics as they provided guidance and direction as I continue to build my knowledge in online course development and design. Suggestions:I would suggest requiring students to respond to discussions using other modes of communication other than writing. I realize some people are new to online learning or don't feel comfortable using video and/or voice, but I think it's important that as online leaners we use effective and emerging technologies as appropriate to connect with each other. I'd also suggest changing up the individual community assignment. I'm not exactly how to change it, but I felt it was too passive of an assignment for this course. I do understand that reflection is an important part of the learning process, but maybe there would be a way to pair up with someone in class and review a community together and have conversations about the community throughout the course.

Q,"CI 5323 Summative Reflections by Q Sangwan The class started on a positive note as there were many enthusiastic and talented learners. I enjoyed the interactions and positive feedback that I received from my classmates and facilitator. The class moved at a fast pace and sometimes it was hard to keep up with as we all had busy schedules.I learned that a sense of community is important to online learners and correlates with their success (Sadera W., Robertson, J. et al). It is more difficult to build community from a distance but it can be accomplished. Designing the course clearly and concisely, timely feedback with active discussions in a forum all contribute to an interactive online learning environment. I learned that _meaning is negotiated through interactions with others while multiple perspectives on reality existÓ Von Glasserfield, 1988). Social relationships are embedded in _norms and values, rules and roles, beliefs and idealsÓ (Kirschner, P. 2004). Sharing of knowledge is essential to effective teaching and learning. Collaborative processes should be in place in the online learning environment. The extent to which instructors use collaborative learning depends upon their beliefs about teaching and learning. _I learned that _learning communities can minimize the riskÓ (Palloff, R. and Pratt, K.) for learners. For all learners reflection is an essential part of learning and we had opportunities to participate in that throughout the course.I learned that social games are becoming increasingly popular especially among elementary students. Games have clear objectives with activities that are achievable so people like the progression of accomplishment.I learned about asynchronous and synchronous communication in online learning. Both are relevant to online learners in he context that they are used.The class charter: The part that is hardest for me is to provide feedback in an honest, constructive and substantive manner. I did do that and it became easier as I practice it.The class succeeded in essential elements and I would add that the only area would be responsiveness by classmates in a substantive and constructive manner.",0,1,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,Week 14,1,Peripheral

Q,"My definition of online community was limited to how students become self motivated, intrinsic learners as they have more choices in the learning process. Technology can be intimidating but with active learning and support as the mantra those hurdles can be overcome. I agree with the author in that "" the outcome of well-constructed, community orients online course is reflective/transformative learning"" (page 17). Collaboration is key to the success of an online course. Self evaluation is a crucial part of learning to create empowered learners.As expected my definition has expanded greatly from the time we started this class. As I have grown in knowledge and skills I reflect that motivation is huge part of learning and the motivators we had every week enriched my day.

I,"Revisiting my envisioned ""online community"" at the beginning of the semester has showed me how much I have grown since the beginning of the semester. For the most part my conceptions have remained the same. One thing that shifted is that my envision of an online community or online learning community is something that keeps growing within time. There is so much more to know about an online community than we really think. It's about the trust that is built upon everyone from within the group. We must learn to include everyone because those who feel are more actively participating feel like they are more part of the community than those who aren't active participants. Everyone comes from different experiences, and one of the best part about an online community is that we can actually hear/read everyone's story.Honesty: _In this class I see that we did a good job with honesty because everyone engaged was able to share their own experiences.Responsiveness: Out of the six ""essential"" elements I would say that responsiveness was the one we lacked the most. Everyone seem to post at different times and we participated enough to get the job done only. I felt we could have kept stronger dialogues going. Relevance: We all did a good job of taking information from the outside world and bringing it into the classroom. Everyone shared their own experience and talked about how the text relates to them. Respect: Respect is something that is definitely there. I didn't see a time where we didn't respect one another. Openness: I felt I was open about sharing any knowledge I know. Empowerment: Empowerment was definitely there in all the participants. Everyone will be empowered by the information they learned. The establishment of ""Participation Expectations & Interaction Guidelines"" helped shape your experiences by holding us accountable to doing what we say is important in establishing an online learning community. These were set guidelines that helped ourselves know what to expect from our instructor and our peers as well as know what is expected of us. Take aways 1. In order to build a strong online learning community we must be willing to be open and actively participating. The more you participate in discussions, the more you will learn about it.2. It takes time to build an online learning community. We all come here for a similar purpose, and it is important that we build a strong community to gain the best learning experience. Learning from my peers is something that I enjoyed the most. Everyone Bs a different kind of knowledge that is being contributed to this classroom.My only suggestion for future Cl 5323 courses would be to just keep this class going with the same kind of energy we had going this semester.

K,"a) Revisiting my thoughts from how I defined an online community at the beginning of the semester, my conceptions has shifted and remained the same. I focused mainly on the connecting with others around the world for an online community in my first definition. There is so much more yet to add to my definition of an online community. Online learning communities consist of individuals who come together for a shared purpose and share their knowledge with each other. There's a sense of community that is built through trust of one another which happens through being open with each other. It is a safe environment where we may not always agree, but we respect and value one another's opinion.b) Honesty, responsiveness, relevance, respect, openness, empowerment. This class tackled down every one of these six ""essential"" elements. The number one of the six ""essential"" elements that we did best on was respect. There was respect shown throughout the conversations we held and everyone valued one another's opinion. We lacked most in responsiveness. Overall, it wouldn't be a community without participation and creating a space where we learn. I did feel we were a bit short on responsiveness because there are times where people post weeks after the deadline and we have all already moved on to a new topic already and we forget go back to check on the other forums.c) The establishment of Participation Expectations & Interactions Guidelines shape your experiences by knowing for myself what is expected of me. By having guidelines of what my peers want me to do, I pushed myself to hold myself accountable to being the best participant I can be. It also shaped my experience by knowing that my peers will be engaging in the same course work as me, and they have the same participation expectation and interaction as I do, meaning that if we don't get our things done on time it would be hard to keep the online community going. Lastly, I felt that the participation expectation and interaction guidelines allowed me to know what is being expected of Instructor as the instructor. By having guidelines for the instructor it makes the shared space we have here really turn into a community because Instructor has her own expectations.d) Takeaway 1: Responding to different classmates makes everyone feel included and a part of the community.Takeaway 2: When creating your own lesson to teach the class, you learn much more from searching up information to present. Presenting information can be done in several different ways. Keep your options open.e) My suggestion for future Cl 5323 courses would be to add another synchronous and also set up a one-to-one opportunity to get to know you (Instructor) as the instructor more. In another one of my online class we set up a one-to-one with our instructor and after that one-to-one I felt like I had a closer relationship to my instructor.

P,"Compared to very beginning of the course, my conception is slightly changed. On week 2 discussion, I said the online community is small challenge. The reason i called it as small challenge is that the online class has some differences form the off line class and due to those differences it could be more challenging than normal class. I still agree with that the online community needs more participation and responsibility than normal class.What is a bit changed in my mind is that online community is more active than normal class sometimes. I thought online community is only virtual space so the real connection between colleagues cannot be made. However it stimulates learners more to build fellowship.In addition, learning in online community is an active process in which both the instructor and the learners must participate it if it is to be successful. And I think this course was pretty much more successful in all aspects than I expected.I totally agree that those six elements are essential for online learning. I think this class succeed almost all of those elements. I felt responsiveness, relevance and empowerment from group work, and found respect from all around the community space.From Participation expectations and interaction guideline, a few things have shaped my experience. First of all, I felt engagement in this course. I have taken three online classes, but this course was the most powerful course, which made me feeling of engagement. _This was the first time I participated in group work through virtual class and that gave me the confidence to do better in future.The first _take awayÓ from the course is another online community experience. I chose Flickr for my individual blog work. Even though the Flickr community was not that interactive as I expected, It stimulated me to join my personal blog. I decided to make my personal blog to collect what I am interested in such as interior design, photography or movie something like that. The second _take awayÓ from the course is I am getting more interested in online learning course. If I have a chance to take another online course later, I will sure take it.As M mentioned, the course was so perfect but if there is earlier chance to meet synchronously earlier in the semester, it would be great!

I,"M,I really liked how even though Flickr didn't work as well as you wanted it to,  you went ahead and found a way to make Flickr become a community space for you.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Week 14,0,Starter
